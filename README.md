# Social Scheduler

A Twitter scheduling app built with Rails 7, StimulusJS & TailwindCSS. The app uses the `devise` gem for authentication and makes use of `sidekiq` for queuing jobs which meant I also had exposure to `redis`, the popular in-memory data structure store. To connect to the Twitter API I used the `omniauth-twitter` gem. StimulusJS was used to make the app more interactive and was used for drop-down menus, notifications and character counting. 

Overall, this project furthered my Rails knowledge and was a good opportunity to learn new concepts such as job queing and frameworks like StimulusJS.
